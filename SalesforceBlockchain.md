## Hyperledger Sawtooth protocol
* Salesforce Blockchain lets you create blockchain networks, data, and apps 
* It helps you make blockchain data actionable using the built-in capabilities of Lightning Flows, Search, Einstein AI, etc.
* It helps you easily engage your blockchain network partners using Lightning apps, community, or prebuilt APIs for supporting partners that are not using Salesforce.
### Consensus management: 
It’s a logic the network uses to agree on an update to the blockchain database. Salesforce offers a variety of consensus protocols (rules for defining how the network arrives at a consensus) so networks can decide which process works best for their needs.
### Smart contracts API: 
API that enables developers to create a set of business rules and deploy them across the network. 
### Query API: 
API that enables you to query the blockchain either for entity definition or a specific record. 
### History API: 
API that enables you to query a record and view the various versions and how it has changed over time. 
### Blockchain Events—workflow: 
Use Platform Events to capture activity from the blockchain and expose it to Salesforce workflow. Automate actions around blockchain data.
### Partner Permissions API: 
API that enables all partners read and write access controls for objects and fields.
### Blockchain Connect: 
A data synchronization service to configure blockchain objects and fields to display on record pages on Lightning Apps or Community, or in custom apps. 

When setting up a blockchain, you have to do the following: 
1. Create a data model and network.
2. Decide on rules and permissions.
3. Create an engagement layer for partners.
4. Build a user experience to show data.
5. Integrate with non-blockchain data. 
6. On-board and incentivize.
